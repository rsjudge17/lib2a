# LIB to A converter #
Free Open Source program - GNU GPL Licence.


## Overview ##

This tool automatically converts a .LIB file (MS Visual C linker library)
into .A file (MinGW linker library).<br />
It is useful to make a C/C++ program a reusable component.

I have written it because I did not have found a such tool over the Net.


## Description ##

The main program is **LIB2A.bat** that performs successive stages for
converting .LIB file to .A file into in the "_convert_" folder.


## How it works ##

The conversion process is accomplished in several steps:<br />
  1. Copy your .**LIB** file and .**DLL** file into the "_convert_" folder.<br />
  1. Edit and replace the files names in the four first lines at the **LIB2A.bat**.<br />
  1. Run **LIB2A.bat**.

You can find your .**A** linker library into the "_convert_" folder.


## License ##

The LIB to A program is under the GNU GPL license, that minds you may use it
and distribute it freely, providing the copyright is unchanged.<br />
See at the COPYING file for details. This doesn't mean GNU encourages you to
convert your LIB file to A file. In fact, most of the tools here included may
help C/C++ programmers.
